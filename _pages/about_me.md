Hello, welcome to Bowen Yang's page. Currently I'm a Ph.D. student at [Department OF Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/), the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My research mainly focuses on the scene understanding and navigation problem of mobile robots in complex 3D environments. I'm also interested in SLAM, deep learning and 3D reconstruction.

I received my bachelor degree at [Department of Electronic and Information Engineering (EIE)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eee/), the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). After that, I worked as an exchange researcher in [Robotic Systems Lab (RSL)](https://rsl.ethz.ch/), Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich).

More details regarding my research works can be found on <a href="projects">Projects</a>. Please feel free to <a href="mailto:byangar@connect.ust.hk">contact me</a> if you are interested in my projects. Collaborations in any forms are welcomed!
