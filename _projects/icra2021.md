<h5> 
Navigation on challenging terrain topographies requires the understanding of robotsâ€™ locomotion capabilities to produce optimal solutions.
Traditional navigation approaches which simply classify traversability and understand the planning cost as distances, are unsuitable for quadrupedal robots confronting complicated navigation tasks.
</h5>

<h5>
We present an integrated framework for real-time autonomous navigation of mobile robots based on elevation maps. 
The framework performs rapid global path planning and optimization that is aware of the locomotion capabilities of the robot. 
A GPU-aided, sampling-based path planner combined with a gradient-based path optimizer provides optimal paths by using a neural network-based locomotion cost predictor.

    A local motion cost predictor trained in simulation provides cost estimates to a sampling-based planner and a gradient-based optimizer. 
    The path planner achieves fast computation time by sampling a fixed set of motions batched on GPU. 
    The gradient-based optimizer refines the raw path by applying cost-gradients to path nodes.

<h5>
We show that our approach is capable of planning and optimizing paths three orders of magnitude faster than RRT* on GPU-enabled hardware, enabling real-time deployment on mobile platforms.

We successfully evaluate the framework on the ANYmal C quadrupedal robot in both simulations and real-world environments for path planning tasks on multiple complex terrains.
