Navigation on challenging terrain topographies requires the understanding of robotsâ€™ locomotion capabilities to produce optimal solutions. 
We present an integrated framework for real-time autonomous navigation of mobile robots based on elevation maps. 
The framework performs rapid global path planning and optimization that is aware of the locomotion capabilities of the robot. 
A GPU-aided, sampling-based path planner combined with a gradient-based path optimizer provides optimal paths by using a neural network-based locomotion cost predictor which is trained in simulation. 

We show that our approach is capable of planning and optimizing paths three orders of magnitude faster than RRT* on GPU-enabled hardware, enabling real-time deployment on mobile platforms.
We successfully evaluate the framework on the ANYmal C quadrupedal robot in both simulations and real-world environments for path planning tasks on multiple complex terrains.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
