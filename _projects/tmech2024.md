<div class="caption">
    Navigating ground robots in 3D environments is essential for a wide range of autonomous applications.
    However, it’s still challenging to efficiently evaluate multilayer scenarios with complex terrain conditions and spatial structures, where a proper environmental representation would assist to improve the scene evaluation speed.

    We propose a highly efficient and extensible global navigation framework based on a tomographic understanding of the environment to navigate ground robots in multi-layer structures.
    Our approach generates <b>tomogram slices</b> using the point cloud map to encode the geometric structure as ground and ceiling elevations.

    Our quadrupedal robot successfully finished these navigation tasks in real-world experiments following the generated trajectories. 
    In "boxes", the robot actively adjusts its body height to avoid the overhangs and prefers to move up to the platform through the gentle slope as the slope has lower travel costs and is safer than the steep stairs.
